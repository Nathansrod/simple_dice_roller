# simple_dice_roller

A simple dice roller application, built using Flutter.

This app was created as part of the Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2024 Edition] course, by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

I have added my own functionality, allowing the user to add up to 6 dice and roll them simultaneously.
